This package contains an infrastructure to process the
control-flow graph dumped by TypeChef. It has no dependencies
on the internals of the Analysis or AST but works entirely
on the serialized CFG and interface files.

`CFGLinker` is an application that performs the linking for
a casestudy in the default setup. 

(Currently the CFGLinker links .cg files, not .cfg files!)
