This package contains an infrastructure to process the
control-flow graph dumped by TypeChef. It has no dependencies
on the internals of the Analysis or AST but works entirely
on the serialized CFG and interface files.

`BusyboxCFGLinker` is an application that performs the linking for
Busybox in the default setup. Shall be moved to the Busybox-Analysis
project after the next release.
